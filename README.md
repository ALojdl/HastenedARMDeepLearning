# HastenedARMDeepLearning
Goal of this project is to implement small OpenCL based framework for deep learning. Idea is to prove that modern Single Board Computers can be ulitized to trin and use deep learning, as they GPGPU are strong enough to support high level of paralelization. Also project is main part of my Master thesis.
